# Fantasy Stock League 
Repo for team FSL 

The Fantasy Stock League aims to destigmatize Investing and promote growth/learning amongst communities. Stocks work similarly to sports betting in that you take a company/player that historically has done well or has the potential to do well and you invest in them in hopes of having a good return. Just like in sports betting your budget is limited and you have to pick multiple players (portfolio diversity) so using those parallels hopefully people's competitive nature pushes them to learn more about investing and trading.
So for the MVP, we focused on a 1v1 head-to-head model where each player gets to pick what stocks they would like to invest in with certain rules in place. The winner would be essentially who had the most return for their investments. For the sake of the MVP, we limited to 3 companies per sector (12 in total) as well as instead of live data we used stock data from 2020 to 2023 for simplicity purposes and time constraints.
Rules:
1. Each player can not invest in the same stock
2. Maximum of 5000 per company
3. minimum of 500 per sector
4. maximum of 500 leftover budget

For a full-scale FSL, it would mirror any prominent fantasy sports league that you would see.
First, we would incorporate live data with an API that auto-updates the stock prices from day to day or how often we would like it to update per game mode.
Secondly, we would have more features such as account creation, custom league creation and monetary incentives. Different game modes such as classic fantasy leagues, play off brackets, tournament head to head.
